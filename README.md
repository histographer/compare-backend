## Database setup
You need to have docker and docker-compose installed. 

Navigate to the folder "database" and execute the script `initialize_database.sh` and the database will build, setup and run. 

The database will by default be available at port localhost:27017 and mongo-express GUI is available in dev mode on localhost:8081.
